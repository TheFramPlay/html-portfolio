    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Harley!
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm a web developer starting from scratch.
    </p>

    <p>I started learning programming originally in 2018. I was attending a coding boot-camp at Southern Careers Institute based out of Austin Texas. Due to some personal issues, I couldn't finish the boot-camp.
      <br>
      After leaving the boot-camp, I had went on to work various jobs. 
      <br>
      I've worked as a:
      <ul>
        <li>Retail/Sales Associate (6mo)</li>
        <li>Sgt. Corrections Officer (2yrs)</li>
        <li>Apprentice Electrician in Construction (1yr)</li>
        <li>Cashier/Supervisor (6mo)</li>
        <li>Apprentice Electrician in Oilfield (6mo)</li>
        <li>Technology Assistant (current)</li>
      </ul>
      Even though I've worked many jobs since attending the coding boot-camp. I would still practice what I knew and learned to keep my mind fresh. I started to really want to do this as I began to have a better head on my shoulders. I never gave up and always knew this is what I wanted to do.
